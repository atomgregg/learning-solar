            <p>My name is Aaron Gregg, an experienced software developer, architect, team player, generalist, leader/coach, an Australian living in Bavaria, Germany since 2010.</p>
            <p>I live in the Oberpfalz, which I liken as the Bavarian Outback, with my wife, 2 children and various chickens. Before moving to this beautiful place on earth, I grew up in Darwin, NT, Australia.</p>
            <p>A big part of my life before moving was hockey, specifically field hockey and the Banks Hockey Club. Through hockey, I gained valuable experiences in coaching, teaching, giving and leadership that became part of who I am, and played a big role in my professional career in software and business.</p>

            <h4 class="v-heading mb-2 text-h6">Motivation</h4>

            <p>Whilst the last year's in my career have been immensely rewarding as a servant leader, strategist and innovator, I have chosen to re-steer my career and invest my time in creating software.</p>
            <p>So much is happening in software right now, re-learning my craft as an engineer and creator is not only immensely rewarding and exciting, it's the perfect timing.</p>
